Stock Market Data Analysis based on Stock Data Up to 2017
The Goal of this Project is an attempt to determine a relationship between two unique stocks that have similar ticker symbols.
Train the Model to try to predict a pattern to the stock price in order to predict a future HIGH price.

# Project Requirements:
###    Research Question and Background: 
###    Import Data:  Stock Market history for the Project Stocks   Ford Motor Company   and   Forward Industries

###    Cleaning Data:
###    Data Visualization:
###    A Model:  (ie comparing two means with a t-test)
###    Conclusion:  
#
# RUNNING THIS PROJECT:
### Install Python version 3.0 or higher
### I used Anaconda and ran via Jupyter Notebook
####   (I had issues using VSCode and could not keep the notebook stable)
### Download the Zip File and Extract All Files
### Open Jupyter Notebook File:  US StockMarket Manipulation 2021.ipynb
###   You will need to set the df to read from the Stock txt files for Ford (f) and for Forward Industries (ford)
### You will also need pandas, numpy, os, matplotlib, and sklearn
