Stock Market Data Analysis based on Stock Data Up to 2017
The Goal of this Project is an attempt to determine a relationship between two unique stocks that have similar ticker symbols.
Train the Model to try to predict a pattern to the stock price in order to predict a future HIGH price.

### Project Requirements:
#    Research Question and Background: 
#    Import Data:  Stock Market history for the Project Stocks   Ford Motor Company   and   Forward Industries
#       This information came from :kaggle.com/datasets
#                                  :https://www.kaggle.com/borismarjanovic/price-volume-data-for-all-us-stocks-etfs
#    Cleaning Data:
#    Data Visualization:
#    A Model:  (ie comparing two means with a t-test)
#    Conclusion:  
#
### RUNNING THIS PROJECT:
# Install Python version 3.0 or higher
# I used Anaconda and ran via Jupyter Notebook
#   (I had issues using VSCode and could not keep the notebook stable)
# Download the Zip File and Extract All Files
# Open Jupyter Notebook File:  US StockMarket Manipulation 2021.ipynb
#   You will need to set the df to read from the Stock txt files for Ford (f) and for Forward Industries (ford)
# You will also need pandas, numpy, os, matplotlib, and sklearn
